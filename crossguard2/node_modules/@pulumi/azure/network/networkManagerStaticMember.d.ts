/**
 * Manages a Network Manager Static Member.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const current = azure.core.getSubscription({});
 * const exampleNetworkManager = new azure.network.NetworkManager("example", {
 *     name: "example-network-manager",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     scope: {
 *         subscriptionIds: [current.then(current => current.id)],
 *     },
 *     scopeAccesses: [
 *         "Connectivity",
 *         "SecurityAdmin",
 *     ],
 *     description: "example network manager",
 * });
 * const exampleNetworkManagerNetworkGroup = new azure.network.NetworkManagerNetworkGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-group",
 *     networkManagerId: exampleNetworkManager.id,
 *     description: "example network group",
 * });
 * const exampleVirtualNetwork = new azure.network.VirtualNetwork("example", {
 *     name: "example-vnet",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     addressSpaces: ["192.168.1.0/24"],
 *     location: example.location,
 * });
 * const exampleNetworkManagerStaticMember = new azure.network.NetworkManagerStaticMember("example", {
 *     name: "example-nmsm",
 *     networkGroupId: exampleNetworkManagerNetworkGroup.id,
 *     targetVirtualNetworkId: exampleVirtualNetwork.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Network Manager Static Member can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:network/networkManagerStaticMember:NetworkManagerStaticMember example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkManagers/networkManager1/networkGroups/networkGroup1/staticMembers/staticMember1
 * ```
