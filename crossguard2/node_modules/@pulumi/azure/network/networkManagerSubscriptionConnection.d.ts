/**
 * Manages a Network Manager Subscription Connection which may cross tenants.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const current = azure.core.getSubscription({});
 * const exampleNetworkManager = new azure.network.NetworkManager("example", {
 *     name: "example-networkmanager",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     scope: {
 *         subscriptionIds: [current.then(current => current.id)],
 *     },
 *     scopeAccesses: ["SecurityAdmin"],
 * });
 * const exampleNetworkManagerSubscriptionConnection = new azure.network.NetworkManagerSubscriptionConnection("example", {
 *     name: "example-nsnmc",
 *     subscriptionId: current.then(current => current.id),
 *     networkManagerId: exampleNetworkManager.id,
 *     description: "example",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Network Subscription Network Manager Connection can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:network/networkManagerSubscriptionConnection:NetworkManagerSubscriptionConnection example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkManagerConnections/networkManagerConnection1
 * ```
