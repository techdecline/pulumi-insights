/**
 * Manages an Elasticsearch in Elastic Cloud.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const test = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("test", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const testElasticsearch = new azure.elasticcloud.Elasticsearch("test", {
 *     name: "example-elasticsearch",
 *     resourceGroupName: test.name,
 *     location: test.location,
 *     skuName: "ess-consumption-2024_Monthly",
 *     elasticCloudEmailAddress: "user@example.com",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Elasticsearch's can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:elasticcloud/elasticsearch:Elasticsearch example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Elastic/monitors/monitor1
 * ```
