/**
 * Manages a Stack HCI Deployment Setting.
 *
 * > Note: Completion of the prerequisites of deploying the Azure Stack HCI in your environment is outside the scope of this document. For more details refer to the [Azure Stack HCI deployment sequence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/deploy/deployment-introduction#deployment-sequence). If you encounter issues completing the prerequisites, we'd recommend opening a ticket with Microsoft Support.
 *
 * > Note: During the deployment process, the service will generate additional resources, including a new Arc Bridge Appliance and a Custom Location containing several Stack HCI Storage Paths. The provider will attempt to remove these resources on the deletion or recreation of `azure.stack.HciDeploymentSetting`.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Stack HCI Deployment Settings can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:stack/hciDeploymentSetting:HciDeploymentSetting example /subscriptions/12345678-1234-9876-4563-123456789012/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/clusters/clus1/deploymentSettings/default
 * ```
