/**
 * Manages a Container App Environment.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleAnalyticsWorkspace = new azure.operationalinsights.AnalyticsWorkspace("example", {
 *     name: "acctest-01",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     sku: "PerGB2018",
 *     retentionInDays: 30,
 * });
 * const exampleEnvironment = new azure.containerapp.Environment("example", {
 *     name: "my-environment",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     logsDestination: "log-analytics",
 *     logAnalyticsWorkspaceId: exampleAnalyticsWorkspace.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * A Container App Environment can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:containerapp/environment:Environment example "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resGroup1/providers/Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments/myEnvironment"
 * ```
