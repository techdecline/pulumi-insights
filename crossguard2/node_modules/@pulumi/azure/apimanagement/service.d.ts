/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleService = new azure.apimanagement.Service("example", {
 *     name: "example-apim",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     publisherName: "My Company",
 *     publisherEmail: "company@exmaple.com",
 *     skuName: "Developer_1",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * API Management Services can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:apimanagement/service:Service example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/instance1
 * ```
