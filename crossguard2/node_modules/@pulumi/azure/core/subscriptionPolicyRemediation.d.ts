/**
 * Manages an Azure Subscription Policy Remediation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = azure.core.getSubscription({});
 * const exampleGetPolicyDefintion = azure.policy.getPolicyDefintion({
 *     displayName: "Allowed resource types",
 * });
 * const exampleSubscriptionPolicyAssignment = new azure.core.SubscriptionPolicyAssignment("example", {
 *     name: "exampleAssignment",
 *     subscriptionId: example.then(example => example.id),
 *     policyDefinitionId: exampleGetPolicyDefintion.then(exampleGetPolicyDefintion => exampleGetPolicyDefintion.id),
 *     parameters: JSON.stringify({
 *         listOfAllowedLocations: {
 *             value: [
 *                 "West Europe",
 *                 "East US",
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     }),
 * });
 * const exampleSubscriptionPolicyRemediation = new azure.core.SubscriptionPolicyRemediation("example", {
 *     name: "example",
 *     subscriptionId: example.then(example => example.id),
 *     policyAssignmentId: exampleSubscriptionPolicyAssignment.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Policy Remediations can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:core/subscriptionPolicyRemediation:SubscriptionPolicyRemediation example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/remediations/remediation1
 * ```
