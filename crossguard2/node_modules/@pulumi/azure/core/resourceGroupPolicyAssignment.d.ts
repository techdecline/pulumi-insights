/**
 * Manages a Resource Group Policy Assignment.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleDefinition = new azure.policy.Definition("example", {
 *     name: "only-deploy-in-westeurope",
 *     policyType: "Custom",
 *     mode: "All",
 *     displayName: "my-policy-definition",
 *     policyRule: ` {
 *     "if": {
 *       "not": {
 *         "field": "location",
 *         "equals": "westeurope"
 *       }
 *     },
 *     "then": {
 *       "effect": "Deny"
 *     }
 *   }
 * `,
 * });
 * const exampleResourceGroupPolicyAssignment = new azure.core.ResourceGroupPolicyAssignment("example", {
 *     name: "example",
 *     resourceGroupId: example.id,
 *     policyDefinitionId: exampleDefinition.id,
 *     parameters: `    {
 *       "tagName": {
 *         "value": "Business Unit"
 *       },
 *       "tagValue": {
 *         "value": "BU"
 *       }
 *     }
 * `,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Resource Group Policy Assignments can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:core/resourceGroupPolicyAssignment:ResourceGroupPolicyAssignment example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/assignment1
 * ```
