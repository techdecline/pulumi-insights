/**
 * Manages a Subscription Policy Assignment.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const current = azure.core.getSubscription({});
 * const example = new azure.policy.Definition("example", {
 *     name: "only-deploy-in-westeurope",
 *     policyType: "Custom",
 *     mode: "All",
 *     displayName: "Allowed resource types",
 *     policyRule: ` {
 *     "if": {
 *       "not": {
 *         "field": "location",
 *         "equals": "westeurope"
 *       }
 *     },
 *     "then": {
 *       "effect": "Deny"
 *     }
 *   }
 * `,
 * });
 * const exampleSubscriptionPolicyAssignment = new azure.core.SubscriptionPolicyAssignment("example", {
 *     name: "example",
 *     policyDefinitionId: example.id,
 *     subscriptionId: current.then(current => current.id),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Subscription Policy Assignments can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:core/subscriptionPolicyAssignment:SubscriptionPolicyAssignment example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/assignment1
 * ```
