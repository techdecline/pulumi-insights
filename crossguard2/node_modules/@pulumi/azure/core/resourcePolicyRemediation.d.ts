/**
 * Manages an Azure Resource Policy Remediation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "resourcegroup1",
 *     location: "West US",
 * });
 * const exampleVirtualNetwork = new azure.network.VirtualNetwork("example", {
 *     name: "vnet1",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: example.location,
 *     addressSpaces: ["10.0.0.0/16"],
 * });
 * const exampleDefinition = new azure.policy.Definition("example", {
 *     name: "only-deploy-in-westeurope",
 *     policyType: "Custom",
 *     mode: "All",
 *     displayName: "my-policy-definition",
 * });
 * const exampleResourcePolicyAssignment = new azure.core.ResourcePolicyAssignment("example", {
 *     name: "assignment1",
 *     resourceId: exampleVirtualNetwork.id,
 *     policyDefinitionId: exampleDefinition.id,
 *     parameters: pulumi.jsonStringify({
 *         listOfAllowedLocations: {
 *             value: [
 *                 example.location,
 *                 "East US",
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     }),
 * });
 * const exampleResourceGroupPolicyAssignment = new azure.core.ResourceGroupPolicyAssignment("example", {
 *     name: "example",
 *     resourceGroupId: example.id,
 *     policyDefinitionId: exampleDefinition.id,
 * });
 * const exampleResourcePolicyRemediation = new azure.core.ResourcePolicyRemediation("example", {
 *     name: "remediation1",
 *     resourceId: exampleVirtualNetwork.id,
 *     policyAssignmentId: exampleResourceGroupPolicyAssignment.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Policy Remediations can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:core/resourcePolicyRemediation:ResourcePolicyRemediation example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm1/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/remediations/remediation1
 * ```
