/**
 * Manages a Resource Deployment Script of Azure PowerShell.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleUserAssignedIdentity = new azure.authorization.UserAssignedIdentity("example", {
 *     name: "example-uai",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 * });
 * const exampleResourceDeploymentScriptPowerShell = new azure.core.ResourceDeploymentScriptPowerShell("example", {
 *     name: "example-rdsaps",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: "West Europe",
 *     version: "8.3",
 *     retentionInterval: "P1D",
 *     commandLine: "-name \"John Dole\"",
 *     cleanupPreference: "OnSuccess",
 *     forceUpdateTag: "1",
 *     timeout: "PT30M",
 *     scriptContent: `          param([string] name)
 *             output = 'Hello {0}.' -f name
 *             Write-Output output
 *             DeploymentScriptOutputs = @{}
 *             DeploymentScriptOutputs['text'] = output
 * `,
 *     identity: {
 *         type: "UserAssigned",
 *         identityIds: [exampleUserAssignedIdentity.id],
 *     },
 *     tags: {
 *         key: "value",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Resource Deployment Script can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:core/resourceDeploymentScriptPowerShell:ResourceDeploymentScriptPowerShell example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup1/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts/script1
 * ```
