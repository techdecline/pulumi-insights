/**
 * Manages a Log Analytics (formally Operational Insights) Workspace.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleAnalyticsWorkspace = new azure.operationalinsights.AnalyticsWorkspace("example", {
 *     name: "acctest-01",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     sku: "PerGB2018",
 *     retentionInDays: 30,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Log Analytics Workspaces can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:operationalinsights/analyticsWorkspace:AnalyticsWorkspace workspace1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/workspace1
 * ```
