import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Manages an App Service certificate.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * This example provisions an App Service Certificate from a Local File.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 * import * as std from "@pulumi/std";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleCertificate = new azure.appservice.Certificate("example", {
 *     name: "example-cert",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: example.location,
 *     pfxBlob: std.filebase64({
 *         input: "certificate.pfx",
 *     }).then(invoke => invoke.result),
 *     password: "password123!",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * App Service Certificates can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:appservice/certificate:Certificate example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Web/certificates/certificate1
 * ```
