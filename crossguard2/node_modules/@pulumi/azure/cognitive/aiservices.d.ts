/**
 * Manages an AI Services account.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleAIServices = new azure.cognitive.AIServices("example", {
 *     name: "example-account",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     skuName: "S0",
 *     tags: {
 *         Acceptance: "Test",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * AI Services Account can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:cognitive/aIServices:AIServices account1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/account1
 * ```
