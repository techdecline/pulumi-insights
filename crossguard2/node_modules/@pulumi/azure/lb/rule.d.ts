/**
 * Manages a Load Balancer Rule.
 *
 * > **NOTE** When using this resource, the Load Balancer needs to have a FrontEnd IP Configuration Attached
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "LoadBalancerRG",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const examplePublicIp = new azure.network.PublicIp("example", {
 *     name: "PublicIPForLB",
 *     location: "West US",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     allocationMethod: "Static",
 * });
 * const exampleLoadBalancer = new azure.lb.LoadBalancer("example", {
 *     name: "TestLoadBalancer",
 *     location: "West US",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     frontendIpConfigurations: [{
 *         name: "PublicIPAddress",
 *         publicIpAddressId: examplePublicIp.id,
 *     }],
 * });
 * const exampleRule = new azure.lb.Rule("example", {
 *     loadbalancerId: exampleLoadBalancer.id,
 *     name: "LBRule",
 *     protocol: "Tcp",
 *     frontendPort: 3389,
 *     backendPort: 3389,
 *     frontendIpConfigurationName: "PublicIPAddress",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Load Balancer Rules can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:lb/rule:Rule example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/lb1/loadBalancingRules/rule1
 * ```
