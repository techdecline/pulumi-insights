/**
 * Manages a Dashboard Grafana Managed Private Endpoint.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** This resource will _not_ approve the managed private endpoint connection on the linked resource. This will need to be done manually via Azure CLI, PowerShell, or AzAPI resources. See here for an example that uses AzAPI.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "Canada Central",
 * });
 * const exampleWorkspace = new azure.monitoring.Workspace("example", {
 *     name: "example-mamw",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: example.location,
 *     publicNetworkAccessEnabled: false,
 * });
 * const exampleGrafana = new azure.dashboard.Grafana("example", {
 *     name: "example-dg",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: example.location,
 *     grafanaMajorVersion: "10",
 *     publicNetworkAccessEnabled: false,
 *     azureMonitorWorkspaceIntegrations: [{
 *         resourceId: exampleWorkspace.id,
 *     }],
 * });
 * const exampleGrafanaManagedPrivateEndpoint = new azure.dashboard.GrafanaManagedPrivateEndpoint("example", {
 *     grafanaId: exampleGrafana.id,
 *     name: "example-mpe",
 *     location: exampleGrafana.location,
 *     privateLinkResourceId: exampleWorkspace.id,
 *     groupIds: ["prometheusMetrics"],
 *     privateLinkResourceRegion: exampleGrafana.location,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Dashboard Grafana Managed Private Endpoint Examples can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:dashboard/grafanaManagedPrivateEndpoint:GrafanaManagedPrivateEndpoint example /subscriptions/12345678-1234-9876-4563-123456789012/resourceGroups/resGroup1/providers/Microsoft.Dashboard/grafana/workspace1/managedPrivateEndpoints/endpoint1
 * ```
