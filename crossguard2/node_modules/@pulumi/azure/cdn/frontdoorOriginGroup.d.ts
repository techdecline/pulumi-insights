/**
 * Manages a Front Door (standard/premium) Origin Group.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-cdn-frontdoor",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleFrontdoorProfile = new azure.cdn.FrontdoorProfile("example", {
 *     name: "example-profile",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     skuName: "Standard_AzureFrontDoor",
 * });
 * const exampleFrontdoorOriginGroup = new azure.cdn.FrontdoorOriginGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-origin-group",
 *     cdnFrontdoorProfileId: exampleFrontdoorProfile.id,
 *     sessionAffinityEnabled: true,
 *     restoreTrafficTimeToHealedOrNewEndpointInMinutes: 10,
 *     healthProbe: {
 *         intervalInSeconds: 240,
 *         path: "/healthProbe",
 *         protocol: "Https",
 *         requestType: "HEAD",
 *     },
 *     loadBalancing: {
 *         additionalLatencyInMilliseconds: 0,
 *         sampleSize: 16,
 *         successfulSamplesRequired: 3,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Front Door Origin Groups can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:cdn/frontdoorOriginGroup:FrontdoorOriginGroup example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup1/providers/Microsoft.Cdn/profiles/profile1/originGroups/originGroup1
 * ```
