/**
 * Manages a VMWare Replication Policy.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-rg",
 *     location: "eastus",
 * });
 * const exampleVault = new azure.recoveryservices.Vault("example", {
 *     name: "example-vault",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     sku: "Standard",
 *     classicVmwareReplicationEnabled: true,
 *     softDeleteEnabled: false,
 * });
 * const exampleVMWareReplicationPolicy = new azure.siterecovery.VMWareReplicationPolicy("example", {
 *     name: "example-policy",
 *     recoveryVaultId: exampleVault.id,
 *     recoveryPointRetentionInMinutes: 1440,
 *     applicationConsistentSnapshotFrequencyInMinutes: 240,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * VMWare Replication Policy can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:siterecovery/vMWareReplicationPolicy:VMWareReplicationPolicy example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/vault1/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/vault1/replicationPolicies/policy1
 * ```
