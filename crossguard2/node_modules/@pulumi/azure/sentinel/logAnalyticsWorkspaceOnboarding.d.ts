import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Manages a Security Insights Sentinel Onboarding.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleAnalyticsWorkspace = new azure.operationalinsights.AnalyticsWorkspace("example", {
 *     name: "example-law",
 *     location: example.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     sku: "PerGB2018",
 * });
 * const exampleLogAnalyticsWorkspaceOnboarding = new azure.sentinel.LogAnalyticsWorkspaceOnboarding("example", {
 *     workspaceId: exampleAnalyticsWorkspace.id,
 *     customerManagedKeyEnabled: false,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Security Insights Sentinel Onboarding States can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:sentinel/logAnalyticsWorkspaceOnboarding:LogAnalyticsWorkspaceOnboarding example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup1/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/workspace1/providers/Microsoft.SecurityInsights/onboardingStates/defaults
 * ```
