/**
 * Manages a Search Service.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Supporting API Keys)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleService = new azure.search.Service("example", {
 *     name: "example-resource",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: example.location,
 *     sku: "standard",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using Both AzureAD And API Keys)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleService = new azure.search.Service("example", {
 *     name: "example-resource",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: example.location,
 *     sku: "standard",
 *     localAuthenticationEnabled: true,
 *     authenticationFailureMode: "http403",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Supporting Only AzureAD Authentication)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {
 *     name: "example-resources",
 *     location: "West Europe",
 * });
 * const exampleService = new azure.search.Service("example", {
 *     name: "example-resource",
 *     resourceGroupName: example.name,
 *     location: example.location,
 *     sku: "standard",
 *     localAuthenticationEnabled: false,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Search Services can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azure:search/service:Service example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/service1
 * ```
